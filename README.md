This repository contains source code for a PIM module for the AtroCore Data Platform. AtroPIM is technically an instance of [AtroCore](https://github.com/atrocore/atrocore) which has a PIM module installed on it.

## History
Our software has been in active development since 2018. It all began with a simple idea: to create a better open-source PIM solution for our customers.
Now we have much more :)

### Free vs Paid

Every user, from small businesses to large enterprises, uses the same free core: AtroCore. This core can be extended with additional free and premium modules as needed.
We also offer SaaS Editions, hosted in the cloud, which include some or all premium modules depending on the edition.

- The core modules, including AtroCore, PIM, Import, Export, and several others, are open-source and freely available. These free modules are more than enough for the needs of most users.
- Selected enterprise-level features, such as AI integration, advanced reporting, and automated data quality management, are offered through paid modules.
